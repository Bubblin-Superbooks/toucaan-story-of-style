With subtle differences in their aspect ratios, device handling & user behavior, browser support and screenwise capabilities it is important to understand what the new landscape of the web looks like today and understand exactly what we are up against for a new CSS framework of 2020.</p><p>Here are some of the devices that sport a modern web browser:</p><p><div class=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/assets/master/major-devices.png\" alt=\"Major web devices.\" width=\"100%\" style=\"max-width:100%;\">\n</div></p>",

  "page-20": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">screen-sizes are available on a <strong>linear continuum</strong> of form-factors and that a large phone could easily be considered a phablet or a tablet could easily become more than a desktop and so on depending on hardware and options. Whereas there is a large variation in the form factors available on the web, there is also substantial variation in the way each surface exposes the controls and input methods to the userâ€”ala, accessibility over content. Let's not forget that there are cars too on the web nowâ€”in that they sport a neat web browser for those who need to be online while being on road. And then there are low-powered devices on the budget end of the market, like the Nokia 2.2 on Android (A53 core) or similar that are very popular in their segment as well.</p>",

  "page-33": "<p>Now the desktop in portrait orientation is going to reveal a browser window that is longer in height and shorter in widthâ€”kind of like a mobile phone but on a much bigger piece of glass. In reality a very small group of people use desktops in portrait mode (mostly developers) but the usage is possible nevertheless. Use of portrait mode grows on tabletsâ€”with about 60% iPad users preferring landscape over portrait where as the story flips completely on a smartphone where about ~96% people prefer the portrait mode over landscape depending on content. With Apple Watch, the tiniest of screens on web, I suspect that nearly 100% of usage would be in portrait mode given that the device is physical tied to the wrist that way.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Here are some <a href=\"https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/64749/are-ipads-used-horizontally-or-vertically\">graphs & stats</a> if you're</p>",

Well this discussion kind of uncovers that all of the web is viewed in only two modes of orientationâ€”portrait or landscapeâ€”and square is the geometric point of inflexion where the media query needs to switch from portrait to landscape and vice-versa. Interesting.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This also means that there are only <strong>two states of design</strong> on web no matter which device or orientation one may choose to consume web on.

  "page-35": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">should be where the viewport itself becomes a square and starts flexing in the other direction. Since there are hardly any devices in shape of a perfect square, mathematically speaking we can take it for granted that a webpage will either render in <code>portrait</code> mode or <code>landscape</code>.</p><hr class=\"section\">",
  "page-36": "<h4>Kickstarting The Code</h4><p class=\"  start-chapter\">Now that we have covered some ground for Toucaan to work on let's start wiring up all the ideas discussed above into code. Since a webpage can be rendered in only one of the two states of the viewport, either portrait or landscape, we'll begin with the following ruleset for our new framework:</p><pre class=\"  \">@media only screen and (orientation: portrait) {\n  :root { /* Portrait variables go here.  */ } \n\n  @import url('toucaan/portrait/portrait.css') only</pre>",
  "page-37": "<pre class=\"no-indent  \">screen and (orientation: portrait);   \n}\n\n@media only screen and (orientation: landscape) {    \n  :root { /* Landscape variables go here. */ }\n\n  @import url('toucaan/landscape/landscape.css') only screen and (orientation: landscape); \n}</pre><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The twin code blocks above may not seem like much at this stage but this dual state switch is exactly what we are going to use to go about scaling our layout across all the web devices on the planet. Notice that we are using a standard asynchronous @import call to request only so much CSS that a given \"viewport state\" will require. On the desktop, this state of a given render will not change</p>",
  "page-38": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">unless the browser window is resized or if the user decides to swivel the monitor over.</p><p>Organizing your CSS this way ensures that both \"states\" of every element that will render on the DOM have been considered and then we can be sure that the webpage will scale desirably across the entire spectrum of devices that are on the web. It also helps avoiding a gigantic <code>reset.css</code>/<code>reboot.css</code> which can be a pain on low-powered devices. So hang in there for a little bit and stand by for the next chapter on Toucaan in which we will take up baselining CSS across vendors and introduce scalable responsive typography without use of javascript.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I have setup a tiny repository for <a href=\"https://github.com/bookiza/toucaan\">Toucaan</a> and checked-in all that is under</p>",
